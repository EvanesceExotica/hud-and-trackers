        "Definition": "Your Skill Roll succeeds AND the Ambient Roll succeeds. \n Choose from the Following: <ul> <li>You treat your Skill Roll like a major effect, regardless of it being a crit or not.</li> \n <li>You are inspired, get a Step Bonus to apply to a future Skill Roll.</li> \n You inspire an ally, giving them a Step Bonus to a future skill roll.\n You succeed with such grace that you can immediately take a second action, but it must be different from what you just succeeded at (no double-attack) \n i.e., If a defense roll, you get a counter-attack. \n You don't consume a cypher or other consumable resource used as a boon. \n Your action was resoundingly impactful, allowing you to boost a track by two boxes. \n You gain a resource of some kind. \n You immediately shake off a Negative Effect that's affecting you. \n You’re so satisfied with your success that you can reroll a die roll of your choosing this scene as if you had spent 1 XP to do so.</ul> \n Items: \n The device fuses with one or two other devices in the user’s possession and becomes an entirely new artifact."
